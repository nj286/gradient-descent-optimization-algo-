#### Implemented gradient descent to to find out weight which minimizes the cost.
#### Visualized the contour plot and path of convergence of the gradient descent.
#### Experimented with the number of iteration and step size to observe how GD behave on small and big step sizes.
#### Implemented Stochaistic gradient descent and experimented with different values of step sizes.
